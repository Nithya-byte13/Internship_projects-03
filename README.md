TEMPERATURE CONVERTER WEBSITE

The user will input a temperature in Fahrenheit or
Celsius or kelvin and press a "convert" button. The converted
temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.

My UI includes four main elements:

~Input field for the user to type in their temperature

~Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit

~"Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion

~Display area for the final converted temperature and unit
